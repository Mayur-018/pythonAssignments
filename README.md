## Case Study 1: Student Grade Calculator

All solutions are implemented in [Case Study 1: Student Grade Calculator.py](https://github.com/Mayur-018/pythonAssignments/blob/da84a2fc9643a4a69eb92b8ff3a7a1f99bad4a13/Case%20Study%201%3A%20Student%20Grade%20Calculator.py)

1. Write a program to store marks of 5 students in a dictionary. Each student should have 3 subjects.
2. Create a function to calculate the average marks of each student.
3. Based on the average, assign grades using control statements:
- A: 90 and above
- B: 75–89
- C: 60–74
- Fail: below 60
4. Print the student name, average marks, and grade.
5. Modify the program to display the top scorer’s name and average marks.

1. Write a program to count the number of vowels, consonants, digits, and special characters in a given string.
2. Given a string, reverse each word individually without changing the word order.
3. Check whether a given string is a palindrome using indexing and slicing.
4. Write a program to find the frequency of each character in a string.
5. Demonstrate string immutability by attempting to modify a character and handling the error.

2. Given a list of numbers, create a new list containing only even numbers using list comprehension.
3. Write a program to find the second largest element in a list.
4. Create a nested list and calculate the sum of each inner list.
5. Demonstrate shallow copy and deep copy of a list with mutable elements.

## TUPLE – Coding Questions

All solutions are implemented in [TUPLE – Coding Questions.py](https://github.com/Mayur-018/pythonAssignments/blob/da84a2fc9643a4a69eb92b8ff3a7a1f99bad4a13/TUPLE%20%E2%80%93%20Coding%20Questions.py)

1. Write a program to find the maximum and minimum elements in a tuple.
2. Convert a list of tuples into a dictionary.
3. Count the occurrence of an element in a tuple without using built-in methods.
4. Create a tuple with mutable elements and modify the mutable data inside it.
5. Write a program to swap two tuples.

## SET – Coding Questions

All solutions are implemented in [SET – Coding Questions.py](https://github.com/Mayur-018/pythonAssignments/blob/da84a2fc9643a4a69eb92b8ff3a7a1f99bad4a13/SET%20%E2%80%93%20Coding%20Questions.py)

2. Remove common elements from two sets.
3. Write a program to check whether one set is a subset of another.
4. Iterate over a set and print only elements greater than a given number.
5. Given a list with duplicate values, convert it into a set and back to a list with unique elements.

## Modules Case Study

All solutions are implemented in [student_project](https://github.com/Mayur-018/pythonAssignments/tree/0c8f8853c572e15dd805b88dce8f56c4c19817ce/student_project)

1. Design a student management project using multiple Python modules instead of a single script.
2. Create a user-defined module containing student functions and use it in another Python file.
3. Develop a marks processing system using a separate marks module and import it in main program.
4. Build a report generation module using classes and connect it to main student system.
5. Demonstrate importing modules using import, from … import, and module alias.
6. Create a reusable module that can be used across multiple student applications.
7. Separate attendance, marks, student data, and fee management into different modules and integrate them.
8. Develop a case where predefined modules like math, datetime, or random are required in student management.
9. Create a module and print its built-in properties such as __name__, __file__, and __dict__.
10. Build a complete student mini-project fully modular, demonstrating importance of modular programming.
